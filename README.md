# ANGDCK-V2.0
A simple arcade-style game about shooting ducks made in Java using the Swing library.

The src folder contains all the source code required to make it all work.
  I uploaded only the source code, so it needs to be compiled on the first launch by the user.
  The whole game written by Myself, using java 17.0.1 and an additional Swing library for the visuals.
  Should compile on other versions of Java as well, as long as it includes the Swing library.

The img folder contains all graphics needed for the game. Not much there to it.

Meant to be played using the mouse only. 
Originally written on a Windows PC, so compatibility may vary (It most likely does not exist).

Enjoy!
